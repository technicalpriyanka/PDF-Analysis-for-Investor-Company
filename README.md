# PDF-Analysis-for-Investor-Company
Investor looks at key elements such as future growth prospects, key changes in the business, key triggers, important information that might have a material effect on next year's earnings and growth. 
To extract key information from a PDF for an investor evaluating a company, we need an algorithm that:

üìå Key Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract text from PDF using PyMuPDF (fitz)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify key sections (e.g., "Growth Prospects", "Revenue Forecast")

3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract financial figures (using regex for $ amounts and % values)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Summarize key sections (using TextBlob NLP)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Print insights for investors


The algorithm first applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to identify key sections of a financial report, such as future growth prospects, business changes, and financial triggers. It then extracts and summarizes essential points using **keyword-based filtering**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **AI-driven summarization** to ensure concise yet informative insights. Finally, the extracted data is structured in an **investor-friendly format**, making it easier to evaluate the company's potential, key changes, and factors that may influence earnings and growth.

üõ† Algorithm Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Load PDF and Extract Text
Use PyMuPDF (fitz) or pdfplumber to extract raw text from the document.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess the Text
Remove whitespace, headers, and footers for clean analysis.
Tokenize the text into sentences and words using NLP techniques.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Key Sections
Use Regex & NLP to detect headings like:
‚úÖ Growth Prospects
‚úÖ Financial Triggers
‚úÖ Business Risks & Changes
Extract relevant content under each section.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Perform NLP-Based Summarization
Apply TF-IDF, BERT, or GPT-based models for text summarization.
Focus on extracting insights related to:
Revenue growth & projections
Market trends & competition
Regulatory changes & risks
Key factors affecting future earnings

5Ô∏è‚É£ Financial Data Extraction
Use Regex & NLP to detect:
Revenue, profit, expenses, and forecasts
Numbers, percentages, and financial terms

6Ô∏è‚É£ Output Structured Insights
Present extracted insights in structured formats such as:
JSON, table, or plain text for easy readability.

üöÄ Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
pip install fitz PyMuPDF spacy nltk textblob
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m textblob.download_corpora

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script
python pdf_analysis.py
